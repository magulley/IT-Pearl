<h3>General Information</h3>
<p>
    General Tour Information
All tours are led by a trained guide; no self-guided tours are available. Minors under age 18 are not permitted on tours without a parent or guardian. Various tours are scheduled daily. It is recommended that tours be booked as far in advance as possible to ensure availability. No items (bags, cameras, cell phones, backpack carriers, purses, packs, bottled water, strollers, etc) are allowed into the cave while on tour; however, lockers are available at the park to store these items. It is imperative that you arrive AT LEAST 30 minutes prior to your scheduled tour time. Late arrival may result in the forfeiture of your reserved tour time. We also request that you familiarize yourself with our very important Cave Tour Rules and Reservation & Cancellation Policies. Pets are not allowed on any cavern tour. Please do not leave pets in vehicles while taking a tour.

Please note: video or photography is not permitted inside the cave, with your cell phone or a camera.

If you have symptoms or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, please reschedule your tour for another time. Masks are not required, but are recommended.

The cave has an average temperature of 70° Fahrenheit (21° Celsius) and 99 percent humidity year-round. Most areas are dimly lit and some passages may pass through narrow or enclosed areas. This may be difficult for persons with mobility, respiratory or claustrophobia issues. See our Accessibility Information for more details. Please note that Arizona is in the Mountain time zone, and does NOT participate in daylight saving time.

School and group tours should also read additional information.

    <h3>Booking Cave Tours</h3>
    <p>
        Make Cave Tour Reservations and Book Tickets
Reserve online or call (877) MY-PARKS and select Option #2. You can call seven days a week, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. MST.  Group tours should review additional information.

Please arrive AT LEAST 30 minutes prior to your scheduled tour time. For tours starting at 8 a.m., please arrive at least 15 minutes early. Late arrival may result in the forfeiture of your reserved tour time. Please be advised: video or photography inside the cave is not permitted.

Minors (under age 18) are not allowed on a cave tour without a parent or guardian.

Kartchner Caverns is now following established nationwide protocols to prevent the spread of White Nose Syndrome, a fungal disease that is killing bats. We request that if you have been in another cave or mine since 2005 you do not wear or bring any of the same clothes or shoes as on your other cave trips. If you arrive at Kartchner Caverns wearing shoes that have been in another cave, you will be asked to visit a White Nose Syndrome Decontamination Station, where your shoes will be sprayed down with rubbing alcohol to kill the fungus. Thank you for working with us to protect our bats!
